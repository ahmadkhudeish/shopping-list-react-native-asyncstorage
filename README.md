# Shopping List App - React Native and AsyncStorage

## Overview

This app demonstrates how we can persist, and retrieve data using AsyncStorage.
It uses expo as the packager.

## How to run the app:

To run the app you need multiple things:

1.  Android Studio installed with an Emulator running Android 6.0 Google API 23
2.  You must have an app called Expo installed on your Android smart phone.
3.  Make sure the Emulator is running before starting the app
4.  Open a new terminal window and run the command `git clone https://github.com/ahmadkhudeish/shopping-list-react-native-asyncstorage.git` to clone the repository into a directory inside your machine
5.  Go inside this directory by running `cd shopping-list-react-native-asyncstorage/react-native-app`
6.  Run the command `npm install` to install necessary node_modules
7.  Once that is done, run the command `npm run android` to start the app packager and run the application
